[Yugabyte JDBC driver](https://github.com/yugabyte/pgjdbc) is a distributed JDBC driver for [YSQL](../../api/ysql/) built on the [PostgreSQL JDBC driver](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc).
Although the upstream PostgreSQL JDBC driver works with YugabyteDB, the Yugabyte driver enhances YugabyteDB by eliminating the need for external load balancers.
The driver has the following features:

- It is **cluster-aware**, which eliminates the need for an external load balancer.

  The driver package includes a `YBClusterAwareDataSource` class that uses one initial contact point for the YugabyteDB cluster as a means of discovering all the nodes and, if required, refreshing the list of live endpoints with every new connection attempt. The refresh is triggered if stale information (older than 5 minutes) is discovered.

- It is **topology-aware**, which is essential for geographically-distributed applications.

  The driver uses servers that are part of a set of geo-locations specified by topology keys.

## Load balancing

The Yugabyte JDBC driver has the following load balancing features:

- Uniform load balancing

    In this mode, the driver makes the best effort to uniformly distribute the connections to each YugabyteDB server. For example, if a client application creates 100 connections to a YugabyteDB cluster consisting of 10 servers, then the driver creates 10 connections to each server. If the number of connections are not exactly divisible by the number of servers, then a few may have 1 less or 1 more connection than the others. This is the client view of the load, so the servers may not be well balanced if other client applications are not using the Yugabyte JDBC driver.

- Topology-aware load balancing

    Because YugabyteDB clusters can have servers in different regions and availability zones, the YugabyteDB JDBC driver is topology-aware. This means it can be configured to create connections only on servers that are in specific regions and zones. This is beneficial for client applications that need to connect to the geographically nearest regions and availability zone for lower latency; the driver tries to uniformly load only those servers that belong to the specified regions and zone.

The Yugabyte JDBC driver can be configured with popular pooling solutions such as Hikari and Tomcat. Different pools can be configured with different load balancing policies if required. For example, an application can configure one pool with topology awareness for one region and its availability zones, and configure another pool to talk to a completely different region.

## Getting the driver

You have a choice of obtaining the driver from Maven or creating it yourself.

### Obtain the driver from Maven

To get the driver and HikariPool from Maven, add the following lines to your Maven project:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.yugabyte</groupId>
  <artifactId>jdbc-yugabytedb</artifactId>
  <version>42.3.0</version>
</dependency>

<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.zaxxer/HikariCP -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.zaxxer</groupId>
  <artifactId>HikariCP</artifactId>
  <version>4.0.3</version>
</dependency>
```

### Build the driver

To build the driver locally, follow this procedure:

1. For the build environment, [gpgsuite](https://gpgtools.org/) needs to be present on the machine where the build is performed. Install GPG and create a key.

2. Clone the following repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yugabyte/pgjdbc.git && cd pgjdbc
   ```

3. Checkout the `yugabyte` branch.

   ```sh
   git checkout yugabyte
   ```

4. Build and install into your local Maven folder.

   ```sh
   ./gradlew publishToMavenLocal -x test -x checkstyleMain
   ```

5. Add the following lines to your Maven project:

   ```xml
   <dependency>
     <groupId>com.yugabyte</groupId>
     <artifactId>jdbc-yugabytedb</artifactId>
     <version>42.3.0</version>
   </dependency>
   ```

{{< note title="Note">}}

The driver requires YugabyteDB version 2.7.2.0 or higher, and Java 8 or above.

### Load balancing connection properties

The following connection properties need to be added to enable load balancing:

- load-balance - enable cluster-aware load balancing by setting this property to `true`; disabled by default.
- topology-keys - provide comma-separated geo-location values to enable topology-aware load balancing. Geo-locations can be provided as `cloud.region.zone`.

## Use the driver

The YugabyteDB JDBC driverâ€™s driver class is `com.yugabyte.Driver`.

To use the driver, do the following:

- Pass new connection properties for load balancing in the connection URL or properties pool.

  To enable uniform load balancing across all servers, you set the `load-balance` property to `true` in the URL, as per the following example:

  ```java
  String yburl = "jdbc:yugabytedb://127.0.0.1:5433/yugabyte?user=yugabyte&password=yugabyte&load-balance=true";
  DriverManager.getConnection(yburl);
  ```

  To specify topology keys, you set the `topology-keys` property to comma separated values, as per the following example:

  ```java
  String yburl = "jdbc:yugabytedb://127.0.0.1:5433/yugabyte?user=yugabyte&password=yugabyte&load-balance=true&topology-keys=cloud1.region1.zone1,cloud1.region1.zone2";
  DriverManager.getConnection(yburl);
  ```

- Configure `YBClusterAwareDataSource` for uniform load balancing and then use it to create a connection, as per the following example:

  ```java
  String jdbcUrl = "jdbc:yugabytedb://127.0.0.1:5433/yugabyte";
  YBClusterAwareDataSource ds = new YBClusterAwareDataSource();
  ds.setUrl(jdbcUrl);
  // Set topology keys to enable topology-aware distribution
  ds.setTopologyKeys("cloud1.region1.zone1,cloud1.region2.zone2");
  // Provide more end points to prevent first connection failure
  // if an initial contact point is not available
  ds.setAdditionalEndpoints("127.0.0.2:5433,127.0.0.3:5433");

  Connection conn = ds.getConnection();
  ```

- Configure `YBClusterAwareDataSource` with a pooling solution such as Hikari and then use it to create a connection, as per the following example:

  ```java
  Properties poolProperties = new Properties();
  poolProperties.setProperty("dataSourceClassName", "com.yugabyte.ysql.YBClusterAwareDataSource");
  poolProperties.setProperty("maximumPoolSize", 10);
  poolProperties.setProperty("dataSource.serverName", "127.0.0.1");
  poolProperties.setProperty("dataSource.portNumber", "5433");
  poolProperties.setProperty("dataSource.databaseName", "yugabyte");
  poolProperties.setProperty("dataSource.user", "yugabyte");
  poolProperties.setProperty("dataSource.password", "yugabyte");
  // If you want to provide additional end points
  String additionalEndpoints = "127.0.0.2:5433,127.0.0.3:5433,127.0.0.4:5433,127.0.0.5:5433";
  poolProperties.setProperty("dataSource.additionalEndpoints", additionalEndpoints);
  // If you want to load balance between specific geo locations using topology keys
  String geoLocations = "cloud1.region1.zone1,cloud1.region2.zone2";
  poolProperties.setProperty("dataSource.topologyKeys", geoLocations);

  poolProperties.setProperty("poolName", name);

  HikariConfig config = new HikariConfig(poolProperties);
  config.validate();
  HikariDataSource ds = new HikariDataSource(config);

  Connection conn = ds.getConnection();
  ```

## Try it out

This tutorial shows how to use the Yugabyte JDBC Driver with YugabyteDB. You start by creating a three-node cluster with a replication factor of 3. This tutorial uses the [yb-ctl](../../admin/yb-ctl/#root) utility.
Next, you use [yb-sample-apps](https://github.com/yugabyte/yb-sample-apps/tree/master) to demonstrate the driver's load balancing features and create a Maven project to learn how to use the driver in an application.

{{< note title="Note">}}
The driver requires YugabyteDB version 2.7.2.0 or higher, and Java 8 or above.
{{< /note>}}

### Install YugabyteDB and create a local Cluster

Create a universe with a 3-node RF-3 cluster with some fictitious geo-locations assigned. The placement values used are just tokens and have nothing to do with actual AWS cloud regions and zones.

```sh
$ cd <path-to-yugabytedb-installation>

./bin/yb-ctl create --rf 3 --placement_info "aws.us-west.us-west-2a,aws.us-west.us-west-2a,aws.us-west.us-west-2b"
```

### Check Uniform load balancing using yb-sample-apps

- Download the yb-sample-apps JAR file.

  ```sh
  wget https://github.com/yugabyte/yb-sample-apps/releases/download/v1.4.0/yb-sample-apps.jar
  ```

- Run the SqlInserts workload application, which creates multiple threads that perform read and write operations on a sample table created by the app. Uniform load balancing is enabled by default in all Sql* workloads of the yb-sample-apps, including SqlInserts.

  ```sh
  java -jar yb-sample-apps.jar  \
       --workload SqlInserts \
       --num_threads_read 15 --num_threads_write 15 \
       --nodes 127.0.0.1:5433,127.0.0.2:5433,127.0.0.3:5433
  ```

The application creates 30 connections, 1 for each reader and writer threads. To verify the behavior, wait for the app to create connections and then visit `http://<host>:13000/rpcz` from your browser for each node to see that the connections are equally distributed among the nodes.
This URL presents a list of connections where each element of the list has some information about the connection as shown in the following screenshot. You can count the number of connections from that list, or simply search for the occurrence count of the `host` keyword on that webpage. Each node should have 10 connections.

### Check Topology-aware load balancing using yb-sample-apps

For topology-aware load balancing, run the SqlInserts workload application with the `topology-keys1` property set to `aws.us-west.us-west-2a`; only two nodes will be used in this case.

  ```sh
  java -jar yb-sample-apps.jar \
        --workload SqlInserts \
        --nodes 127.0.0.1:5433,127.0.0.2:5433,127.0.0.3:5433 \
        --num_threads_read 15 --num_threads_write 15 \
        --topology_keys aws.us-west.us-west-2a
  ```

To verify the behavior, wait for the app to create connections and then navigate to `http://<host>:13000/rpcz`. The first two nodes should have 15 connections each, and the third node should have zero connections.

## Clean up

When you're done experimenting, run the following command to destroy the local cluster:

```sh
./bin/yb-ctl destroy
```

## Other examples

To access sample applications that use the Yugabyte JDBC driver, visit [YugabyteDB JDBC driver](https://github.com/yugabyte/pgjdbc).

To use the samples, complete the following steps:

- Install YugabyteDB by following instructions provided in [Quick Start](../../quick-start/).

- Build the examples by running `mvn package`.

- Run the `run.sh` script, as per the following guideline:

  ```sh
  ./run.sh [-v] [-i] -D -<path_to_yugabyte_installation>
  ```

  In the preceding command, replace:

  - *[-v] [-i]* with `-v` if you want to run the script in `VERBOSE` mode.

  - *[-v] [-i]* with `-i` if you want to run the script in `INTERACTIVE` mode.

  - *[-v] [-i]* with `-v -i` if you want to run the script in both `VERBOSE` and `INTERACTIVE` mode at the same time.

  - *<path_to_yugabyte_installation>* with the path to the directory where you installed YugabyteDB.

  The following is an example of a shell command that runs the script:

  ```sh
  ./run.sh -v -i -D ~/yugabyte-2.7.2.0/
  ```

  {{< note title="Note">}}
The driver requires YugabyteDB version 2.7.2.0 or higher.
  {{< /note>}}

  The `run` script starts a YugabyteDB cluster, demonstrates load balancing through Java applications, and then destroys the cluster.

  When started, the script displays a menu with two options: `UniformLoadBalance` and `TopologyAwareLoadBalance`. Choose one of these options to run the corresponding script with its Java application in the background.
